# Stremio V1 protocol 


## Manifest format

The first thing to define for your add-on is the manifest, which describes it's name, purpose and some technical details.

Valid properties are:

``id`` - **required** - identifier, dot-separated, e.g. "com.stremio.filmon"

``name`` - **required** - human readable name

``description`` - **required** - human readable description

``webDescription`` - _optional_ - human readable description for the auto-generated add-on HTML page ; HTML allowed

``endpoint`` - _optional_ - http endpoint to the hosted version of this add-on; should end in standard stremio URL path, such as ``/stremio/v1`` for the v1 version of the protocol; example: ``http://cinemeta.strem.io/stremioget/stremio/v1``

``background`` - _optional_ - background image for the add-on; URL to png/jpg, at least 1024x786 resolution

``logo`` - _optional_ - logo icon, URL to png, monochrome, 256x256

``types`` - **required** - array of supported types, from all the [``Content Types``](/documentation/protocol.md#content-types)

``isFree`` - _optional_ - set this to ``true`` if you want to specify that all of the content in this add-on is free of charge; this is used when auto-generating a landing page for that add-on

``contactEmail`` - **required** - contact email for add-on issues; used for the Report button in the app; also, the Stremio team may reach you on this email for anything relating your add-on

``suggested`` - _optional_ - array of IDs of other add-ons that should be suggested when installing this add-on

``filter`` - _optional_ - object of conditions for query properties that, when matched, increase the priority of the add-on in the call order

```javascript
 "filter": {
   "query.imdb_id": { "$exists": true },
   "projection.imdb_id": { "$exists": true }
  }
// this wil prioritize our add-on for calls with arguments like { query: { imdb_id: ... }  }
```

``sorts`` - _optional_ - additional types of sorting in catalogues; array of sort objects

```javascript
[
  { prop: "popularities.moviedb", name: "SORT_TRENDING", types: ["movie", "series"], noDiscoverTab: false }
]
```

***Tip* - use different sorts to provide different catalogues for your users, e.g. separate "popular movies" and "new movies"**

``searchDebounce`` - _optional_ - how much to de-bounce after the user types before calling ``meta.search``; not all clients use this

``countrySpecific`` - _optional_ - boolean - if true, the stremio client must pass ``countryCode`` of the user along with ``meta.find``. *Example*: add-on for service where the streams are georestricted, e.g. Netflix

``zipSpecific`` - _optional_ - boolean - if true, the stremio client must pass ``zip`` of the user along with  ``meta.find``. *Example*: cinema showtimes guide add-on

***Tip* - to implement sources where streams are geo-restricted (stream.find), see [``Stream object's``](/documentation/protocol.md#stream-object) `geos`**


## All Methods

In your add-on, you can implement the following hooks/methods:

* ``stream.find``
* ``meta.find``
* ``meta.get``
* ``subtitles.get``
* ``stats.get`` 

**To show a catalogue in Discover, you must implement ``meta.find``.**

**To show detailed information about your content (detail page), you must implement ``meta.get``.**

**To implement video streaming for your content, you must implement ``stream.find``.**


## Content types

**Stremio supports the following content types as of Apr 2016:**

* ``movie`` - movie type - has metadata like name, genre, description, director, actors, images, etc. 
* ``series`` - series type - has all the metadata a movie has, plus an array of episodes
* ``channel`` - chnanel type - created to cover YouTube channels; has name, description and an array of uploaded videos
* ``tv`` - tv type - has name, description, genre; streams for ``tv`` should be live (without duration)

**If you think Stremio should add another streaming source, feel free to open an issue at this repo.**



## Method: ``stream.find``
First thing to keep in mind here is that Stremio supports video streaming through HTTP, BitTorrent and IPFS. 

If you are interested in other protocols, contact us at [office@strem.io](mailto:office@strem.io).

### Request format
``query`` - an object containing an ID property with a value to match, plus extra identifying properties.

**The ID property is the first part of your metadata's `universal identifier`**, for example if your metadata ID is ``"yt_id:UCrDkAvwZum-UTjHmzDI2iIw"`` then the query object to `stream.find` is `{ yt_id: "UCrDkAvwZum-UTjHmzDI2iIw" }`.

This is done to allow using properties to help decide which add-on to be called.

Additional properties in ``query`` are used for content that has multipe videos, for example ``series`` or ``channel``.

``query.season`` - _optional_ - the season number, required for ``series`` type

``query.episode`` - _optional_ - the episode number, required for ``series`` type

``query.video_id`` - _optional_ - the video ID, required for ``channel`` type

``prev`` - _optional_ - the previous [``Stream object's``](/documentation/protocol.md#stream-object) ID that the player played; will be ``undefined`` if there isn't any

**Examples**
```javascript
// Request The Wizard of Oz
{ query: { imdb_id: "tt0032138" } }
```
```javascript
// Request pilot of Game of Thrones
{ query: { imdb_id: "tt0944947", season: 1, episode: 1 } }
```
```javascript
// Request Gangnam Style
{ query: { yt_id: "UCrDkAvwZum-UTjHmzDI2iIw", video_id: "9bZkp7q19f0" } }
```


### Response format

Returns an array of [``stream objects``](/documentation/protocol.md#stream-object). Usually either from different sources (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, iTunes) or in different qualities (``480p``, ``720p``, ``1080p``).

_**Tip**: to provide several streams with varying qualities, return an array of [``Stream Objects``](/documentation/protocol.md#stream-object) with different quality tag in their tag array._


#### Stream object

**One of the following must be passed** to point to the stream itself

* ``url`` - direct URL to a video stream - http, https, rtmp protocols supported
* ``externalUrl`` - URL to the video, which should be opened in a browser (webpage), e.g. link to Netflix
* ``yt_id`` - youtube video ID, plays using the built-in YouTube player
* ``infoHash`` and/or ``fileIdx`` - info hash of a torrent file, and mapIdx is the index of the video file within the torrent; **if fileIdx is not specified, the largest file in the torrent will be selected**
* ``mapIdx`` - alias to ``fileIdx``, specifies index of file in case of BitTorrent

**Additional properties to provide information / behaviour flags**

``name`` - _optional_ - name of the stream, e.g. "Netflix"; the add-on name will be used if not specified

``title`` - _optional_ - title of the stream; usually used for stream quality

``availability`` - _optional_ - 0-3 integer representing stream availability, in the context of P2P streams - 0 not available, 1 barely available, 2 OK, 3 highly available

``tag`` - _optional_ - array, optional tags of the stream; use ``"480p"``, ``"720p"``, ``"1080p"``/``"hd"`` or ``"2160p"`` to specify quality

``isFree`` - _optional_ - set this to ``true`` if the stream si free of charge

``isSubscription`` - _optional_ - set this to ``true`` if this stream requires a subscription (e.g. Netflix)

``isPeered`` - _optional_ - set this to ``true`` if this stream is peered locally and therefore delivered with a high speed; useful for areas with slow internet connections, such as India

``subtitles`` - _optional_ - [``Subtitles Objects``](/documentation/protocol.md#subtitles-object) representing subtitles for this stream

``live`` - _optional_ - boolean, specify if this is a live stream; this will be auto-detected if you're using HLS

``repeat`` - _optional_ - boolean, true if you want stremio to do ``stream.find`` again with the same arguments when the video ends, and play the result

``geos`` - _optional_ - use if the stream is geo-restricted - array of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes **in lowercase** in which the stream is accessible

``widgetSidebar`` - _optional_ - URL to a page that will be shown in the Player sidebar instead of usual contents; the page will be rendered in a restricted web view, appending "?item_hash=" at the end with Item Hash

``widgetPlayer`` - _optional_ - URL to a page that will replace the sit on top of the entire Player; the page will be rendered in a restricted web view, appending "?item_hash=" at the end with Item Hash; useful for things like YouTube/Vimeo embeds, as well as showing additional information/functionality when player is paused

``widgetPlayerStates`` - _optional_ - array of the states in which the ``widgetPlayer`` is shown; default is ``["buffering", "loading"]``, which means it will be shown during loading
  
 Possible states are:
  
  * ``buffering`` - while the video is buffering
  * ``loading`` - white the video is initially loading
  * ``paused`` - while the video is paused
  * ``postplay`` - after the video has finished playing
  * ``error`` - upon player error
  * ``device`` - when casting to a device
  * ``replaceplayer`` - entirely replaces the default player with the widget

``meta`` - _optional_ - object, used to specify ``{ season: X, episode: Y }`` in case you're using a [``Stream Object``](/documentation/protocol.md#stream-object) for ``videos`` for a series


**Example**
```javascript
// Result from stremio.stream.find({ query: { imdb_id: "tt0032138" } })
[{ 
  infoHash: "24c8802e2624e17d46cd555f364debd949f2c81e",
  mapIdx: 0, // optional, the file ID - The.Wizard.of.Oz.1939.1080p.BrRip.x264.BOKUTOX.YIFY.mp4 
  tag: ["mp4", "hd", "1080p", "yifi"],
  availability: 2, // good to calculate that based on seeders if we have them - 0 seeders - 0 avail, 0-20 - 1, 20-50 - 2, 50 - ... - 3 
}]
// This would start streaming wizard of oz in HD in Stremio
```

#### Subtitles object

``id`` - **required** - identifier of the subtitles object - could be any string - serves to identify the set of subtitles for a specific video; example of this is the OpenSubtitles MovieHash - if taking subtitles from there, the MovieHash can be used as an ``id``

``itemHash`` - _optional_  - metadata item hash, which is defined as a combination of the [``Metadata object``](/documentation/protocol.md#metadata-object)'s ``id`` followed by ``season`` / ``episode`` or ``video_id``, separated by a white space; example of this is ``tt0898266 9 17``

``all`` - **required** - all of the subtitle variants for this ``id`` - array of 
```javascript
{ id: "string identifier", url: "url to srt file", lang: "language code in ISO 639-1" }
```


------------------------


## Metadata (``meta.find``, ``meta.get``, ``meta.search``)

Stremio's metadata model is designed to support movies, series and video channels (like YouTube channels). All metadata-related modules must return compatible data.

### Request format

### ``Meta Request``

``query`` - MongoDB-like query object, where all objects must be matched against; should support ``$in``, ``$exists``, ``$gt``, ``$lt`` operators; on ``meta.search`` method, this is a string

``projection`` - MongoDB-like projection object, also accepts string values - ``lean``, ``medium`` and ``full``; lean contains name, year, release date, cast, director; medium also includes episodes (if applicable) and the full projection also includes all images and full cast info

``complete`` - only return items with complete (+images) metadata

``limit`` - limit to N results

``skip`` - skip first N results

_**TIP**: If you don't use MongoDB, you can use [sift](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sift) or [linvodb3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linvodb3) to support to the query format._


### Response format

The response is an array of Metadata objects. 

#### Metadata object

``id`` - **required** - universal identifier, formed like "DOMAIN_id:ID", for example "yt_id:UCrDkAvwZum-UTjHmzDI2iIw".

``type`` - **required** - type of the content; e.g. `movie`, `series`, `channel`, `tv`

``name`` - **required** - name of the content

``genre`` - **required**  - genre/categories of the content; array of strings, e.g. ``["Thriller", "Horror"]``

``poster`` - **required** - URL to png of poster; accepted aspect ratios: 1:0.675 (IMDb poster type) or 1:1 (square) ; you can use any resolution, as long as the file size is below 100kb; below 50kb is recommended

``posterShape`` - _optional_ - can be `square` (1:1 aspect) or `regular` (1:0.675) or `landscape` (1:1.77). If you don't pass this, `regular` is assumed

### Methods

#### meta.find
Takes [``Meta Request``](/documentation/protocol.md#meta-request), as described, returns the first matched result in ``full`` projection unless specified otherwise. 

This is used for loading full catalogue in Discover.

#### meta.get
Takes [``Meta Request``](/documentation/protocol.md#meta-request), as described, returns an array of matched results in ``lean`` projection unless specified otherwise.

This is used when double-clicking on items, when opening their detail page. The ``full`` projection returns properties like ``episodes`` and ``uploads``, so this will be especially useful to show ``series`` and ``channel`` types. 

#### meta.search
Perform a text search. Arguments are exactly the same as usual [``Meta Request``](/documentation/protocol.md#meta-request), except ``query`` is a string. Returns an array of [``Metadata Object``](/documentation/protocol.md#metadata-object) matches.

This is used for the Search functionality.
