# Testing your add-on

To test your add-on while developing it, we recomment [stremio-addons-client](http://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addons-client), which is an open-source client to the ecosystem.

When you get it working, you can test in the desktop app following the instructions at: https://github.com/Ivshti/stremio-addons/blob/master/documentation/enabling-addon.md

You should use `test/addon-protocol.js` script to ensure your add-on passes the basic protocol sanity checks.
